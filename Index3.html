 <h1> Paragraphs </h1>

<p> A nursing home will provide all the day-to-day care that you would expect from any care home, but the care is supervised by registered nurses who are on duty all day and all night. Cost of care in the United States is expensive, a private room in a nursing home costs an average of $8,121 a month. For a semi-private room, the average cost is $7,148 a month.  The cost of a nursing home depends on how much a nursing home stay costs including location, size, length of stay and services offered. Many people do not realise the differences between nursing homes and care homes with nursing. Both types of home provide accommodation, supervision from staff 24 hours a day, meals and help with personal care needs, but nursing homes also have registered nurses on duty at all times. Care homes are staffed 24 hours a day and a proportion of the staff will be qualified care assistants with NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications) at Level 2 or 3. The kind of assistance with personal care that can be provided in all care homes includes help with washing, dressing, toileting and mobility. </p>

    <h2> LPN'S </h2>
    <p> LPNs work under the close supervision of registered nurses where they perform many of the same tasks as the nursing assistants. In addition to providing basic care to patients, LPNs also perform more advanced duties. These include monitoring the respiration, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen levels and heart rates of their patients. </p>
