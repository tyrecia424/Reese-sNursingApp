    <h1> The Problem </h1>
<p>The problem is not enough elderly people are getting treated right and some want to stay at home with family but families are always busy so they send them to a nursing home. I want an app that helps elders stay at home or in nursing homes and be safe enough to where they can just press a button so someone can help. Also have cameras where i can see everything that's going on when families are not there. </p>
