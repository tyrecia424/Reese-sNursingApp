        <h1> Reason I am Passionate </h1>
        <p> The reason I want to do all this is because I would never want to see people getting hurt in this world because I would never want someone to do that to me or my family. I help my grandma everytime i'm with her and not at work, so me seeing her struggle is sad that makes me think like I know other people in this world needs help like my grandma. It makes me mad when I see people out here in this world treating people bad because of what they see other people do. Abusing elderly robbing them for they money, yelling at the because they can't do certain stuff no more because they are old. I have been wanting to do this for 3 years now. I'm going to school to be a cna and work at a nursing home or do home care for my grandma and hopefully mother-in-law. My goal is to do this before I turn 21 years old. </p>


 <h1> The Problem </h1>
<p>The problem is not enough elderly people are getting treated right and some want to stay at home with family but families are always busy so they send them to a nursing home. I want an app that helps elders stay at home or in nursing homes and be safe enough to where they can just press a button so someone can help. Also have cameras where i can see everything that's going on when families are not there. </p
